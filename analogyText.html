The client and the server work similarly to a customer and the employees/system of a restaurant. 
Obviously, the client is the customer and the server is the business-side. As the client, 
you can work with one or more servers to retrieve the information you're looking for.
The web is like a menu in which you can view options (although there are more than what you can see).
Clients can make requests of information to your server, and the response will be retreieved from the 
back-end which you don't see (kitchen). When the customer/client knows that they are looking for, 
they make a request to the server and it sends a response.
